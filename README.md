#### By _Daniel Lindsey_

#### A quiz built for the solo section of a Scrimba course.

## Technologies Used

A project showcasing my React skills. This quiz pulls from a trivia database, allows the user to select their answers, and then displays what they got right or wrong. Once the user is ready, they can quickly restart the quiz.

This application was built based off just a Figma design file, located [here](https://www.figma.com/file/E9S5iPcm10f0RIHK8mCqKL/Quizzical-App?node-id=0%3A1)
